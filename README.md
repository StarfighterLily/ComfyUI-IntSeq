---IntSeq---
A custom node for ComfyUI that takes integer sequences and creates sigmas for sampling, or images for masks or encoding into latents. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences ([OEIS](https://oeis.org/)) inspired the name, being the first place I went to get numbers to plug into these.
